title: Trusted system certificates
---

As a <%= vars.platform_name %> admin, you can deploy a set of trusted system certificates. These trusted certificates are available in Linux-based app instances running on the Diego back end. Such instances include buildpack-based apps using the `cflinuxfs[3|4]` stack and Docker image-based apps.

If the admin configures these certificates, they are available inside the instance containers as files with extension `.crt` in the read-only `/etc/cf-system-certificates` directory.

For `cflinuxfs[3|4]`-based apps, these certificates are also installed directly in the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory, and are available to libraries such as `openssl` that respect that trust store. If the administrator configure these certificates, the location of the certificates is provided in the environment variable `CF_SYSTEM_CERT_PATH` on the instance container.
